    "content": "It was raining heavily outside. The thunder and lightning felt as if the sky itself had torn apart. The lights were out, the village was asleep — but one soul was awake.\n\nRocky.\n\nA tiny, speechless, innocent dog, tied to a small kennel. But that night, he sensed something unnatural.\n\nHis ears twitched. He felt tremors through the ground — danger was approaching. Rocky’s instincts awoke — and he suddenly began barking like crazy.\n\nHe barked without stopping, through the storm, from midnight onwards. His owner shouted at him to stop, but Rocky wouldn’t calm down.\n\nAnnoyed and half-asleep, his owner finally opened the door — and saw a strange sight. A bird flew low into the courtyard — and the ground seemed to move.\n\n\"The land is coming!\"\n\nShe screamed and raised the alarm across the village. One by one, the villagers woke up and fled to safety, grabbing nothing.\n\nWithin two minutes, the entire village was buried. No houses remain — only tin sheets and piles of mud. But one thing did remain — life.\n\nBecause of Rocky’s warning, 67 people from 20 families survived that night.\n\nThat innocent animal could not speak or write, but showed a level of awareness many humans lack.\n\nToday, the villagers call Rocky the “Angel of God.” He sleeps again now, tied with an old rope, resting his head on his owner’s lap — but in many hearts, he is forever a hero.",
